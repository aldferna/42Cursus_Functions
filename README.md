## Libft ⭐
The first project at the 42 School. The goal of this project is to create a library of essential C functions that we will use throughout the following projects.
String manipulation, memory management, character handling, linked list operations, and more. All writen in C from scratch.

## Printf 🖨
The ft_printf project is an implementation of the printf function in C. Here you will learn about variadic functions, format specifiers, different data types, and low-level output mechanisms in C. 
Support for ```%c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %p```

## GNL 🏃‍♀️
