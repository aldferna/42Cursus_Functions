# 42 Cursus

## Libft ‚≠ê
The first project at the 42 School.  
Its goal is to build a library of essential C functions that we will use throughout the following projects.  
String manipulation, memory management, character handling, linked list operations, and more. All written in C from scratch.  

## Printf üñ®
The ft_printf project is an implementation of the original printf function in C. Here you will learn about variadic functions, format specifiers, different data types, and low-level output mechanisms in C.   
It supports the following conversions: ```%c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %p```.  

## GNL üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Develop a function capable of reading a line from a file descriptor, without reading the entire file at once.   
This project aims to enhance your understanding of file manipulation, memory allocation/liberation, and static variables.
